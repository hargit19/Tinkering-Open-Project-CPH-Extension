# Tinkering Labs Open Project - VS Code X Leetcode Extension  
VS Code X Leetcode Extension is a VS Code plugin tailored to optimize competitive programming routines by embedding Leetcode capabilities directly into the IDE.  

## What you can do with this  
- Compatible with LeetCode.  
- Retrieve example test cases for questions and save them locally.  
- Execute code against stored test cases directly within VS Code, displaying results instantly.  
- Highlights mismatches when the actual output differs from the expected output.

## Installation Process  
Follow these steps to set up and use the extension:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

2. **Go to the main direcotory**
   ```bash
   cd cph-leetcode-fetcher

3. Start debugging the code
4. An Extension Host Environment is setup and opened in the VS Code Editor.
5. Start with running the command 'fetch leetcode test cases' and putting the input as the link to the leetcode problem (Example: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
6. Once the test cases are fetched, you will the fetched input and output files in the .txt format.
7. Once fetched, run the 'run leetcode test cases' command and give the path to the solution file as the input (Example: C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\New folder\sol.cpp)
8. On running the command, you will find the pop-ups showing either 'test cases passed' or 'test case failed'.

## Extension Screenshots
